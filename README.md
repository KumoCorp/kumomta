# KumoMTA

KumoMTA is an open-source Message Transfer Agent (MTA) designed for high-performance outbound email functionality, similar to commercial enterprise MTAs such as Momentum, PowerMTA, and Halon.

The KumoMTA project was founded by a group of email industry veterans with decades of experience building and managing high-performance On-Prem MTAs and is supported by a community of some of the largest senders in the world.

Because it is designed for high-performance sending environments, KumoMTA is for experienced email operations professionals who are accustomed to high-performance sending environments and familiar with DevOps practices.
