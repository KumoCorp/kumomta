# User Guide

This is the KumoMTA User Guide.

The User Guide is intended for those who have a general understanding of operating an MTA and are looking for information on how to use KumoMTA in particular.

Those who are brand new to email operations, or those who just want the minimum
information needed to get started, should refer to the
[Tutorial](../tutorial/quickstart.md).

Those who are experienced at using KumoMTA and are looking for more detailed information on specific commands and functions may be better served by the [Reference Manual](../reference/index.md).
