# Server Environment

KumoMTA can be installed in a physical server, public cloud, or private cloud.  The following environments have all been tested.

* AWS
* Azure
* GCP
* VMWare
* bare metal
* IBM Cloud
* Oracle Cloud
* Contabo

Note that most public cloud platforms block port 25 outbound so you will need to ask for specific permission to use that outbound port.

In any case, the server or instance should be a dedicated resource with as much CPU, RAM, Network bandwidth, and storage IOPS as possible.
