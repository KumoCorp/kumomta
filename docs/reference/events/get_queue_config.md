# `kumo.on('get_queue_config', function(domain, tenant, campaign, routing_domain))`

!!! note
    This event handler is in flux and may change significantly

Not the final form of this API, but this is currently how
we retrieve configuration used for managing a queue.

The parameters correspond to the `domain`, `tenant`, `campaign` and `routing_domain`
fields from the *scheduled queue* name, as discussed in [Queues](../queues.md).

```lua
kumo.on(
  'get_queue_config',
  function(domain_name, tenant, campaign, routing_domain)
    return kumo.make_queue_config {
      max_retry_interval = '20 minutes',
    }
  end
)
```

See also [kumo.make_queue_config](../kumo/make_queue_config/index.md).

{{since('2023.11.28-b5252a41', indent=True)}}
    It is now possible to use `kumo.on` to register multiple handlers for
    this event.  The handlers will be called in the order that they were
    registered.  If a handler returns `nil` then the next handler will be
    called. Conversely, if a handler returns a queue configuration object,
    no further handlers will be called.

    This behavior is intended to make it easier to compose multiple helpers
    or lua modules together.
