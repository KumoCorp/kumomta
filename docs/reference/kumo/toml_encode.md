# kumo.toml_encode

```lua
kumo.toml_encode(VALUE)
```

!!! warning
    This function has moved to the [kumo.serde](../kumo.serde/index.md) module and
    will be removed in a future release.
    {{since('2024.09.02-c5476b89', inline=True)}}

Attempts to encode VALUE as its TOML equivalent, and returns that value
serialized as a string.

This is logically the opposite of [kumo.toml_parse](toml_parse.md).

See also [kumo.toml_load](toml_load.md), [kumo.toml_parse](toml_parse.md)
and [kumo.toml_encode_pretty](toml_encode_pretty.md)
