## Log Record

## Record Types

The following record types are defined:

* `"Reception"` - logging the reception of a message via SMTP or via
  the HTTP injection API
* `"Delivery"` - logging the successful delivery of a message via SMTP
* `"Bounce"` - logging a permanent failure response and end of delivery
  attempts for the message.
* `"TransientFailure"` - logging a transient failure when attempting delivery
* `"Expiration"` - logged when the message exceeds the configured maximum
  lifetime in the queue.
* `"AdminBounce"` - logged when an administrator uses the `/api/admin/bounce`
  API to fail message(s).
* `"OOB"` - when receiving an out of band bounce with an attached RFC3464
  delivery status report, the parsed report is used to synthesize an OOB
  record for each recipient in the report.
* `"Feedback"` - when receiving an ARF feedback report, instead of logging
  a `"Reception"`, a `"Feedback"` record is logged instead with the report
  contents parsed out and made available in the `feedback_report` field.
* `"Rejection"` - logging a 4xx or 5xx response generated by KumoMTA
  in response to an incoming SMTP command. {{since('2024.06.10-84e84b89', inline=True)}}
* `"Delayed"` - explains why a message landed in the scheduled queue when
  it doesn't otherwise have a `TransientFailure` record logged. {{since('2025.01.23-7273d2bc', inline=True)}}

## Feedback Report

ARF feedback reports are parsed into a JSON object that has the following
structure.  The fields of the `feedback_report` correspond to those defined
by [RFC 5965](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5965).

See also [trace_headers](kumo/start_esmtp_listener/trace_headers.md) for information
about the `supplemental_trace` field.
