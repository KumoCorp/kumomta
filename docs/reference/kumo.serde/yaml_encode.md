# `kumo.serde.yaml_encode(VALUE)`

{{since('2024.09.02-c5476b89')}}

Attempts to encode VALUE as its YAML equivalent, and returns that value
serialized as a string.

This is logically the opposite of [kumo.serde.yaml_parse](yaml_parse.md).

See also [kumo.serde.yaml_load](yaml_load.md)
and [kumo.serde.yaml_parse](yaml_parse.md).
