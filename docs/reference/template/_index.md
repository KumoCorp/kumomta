# Template Syntax

A number of components and facilities in KumoMTA allow you to use the [Mini
Jinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/) templating engine.  The
full supported syntax is [documented
here](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/syntax/index.html).

In addition to the base functionality, we include additional date/time
formatting filters and globals via
[minijinja_contrib](https://docs.rs/minijinja-contrib/latest/minijinja_contrib/index.html).

An abbreviated list of various functions and filters is included here for the
sake of searchability, but you should consult the resources listed above for a
complete list.

* Builtin filters: [see here](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/filters/index.html)
