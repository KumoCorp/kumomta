!!! info
    This page was generated by extracting information from a JSON Schema
    data file for the API.  It may be missing some information, or otherwise
    suggest approximate or placeholder values based on information in the
    schema file; this is due to limitations on how that data is extracted
    from the underlying Rust code and into the JSON Schema, and then again
    from there and into these docs.

Performs a message transfer.
!!! warning
    This is considered to be an internal API and should not be
    used by external consumers.  It is intentionally under-specified
    in these auto-generated docs.
