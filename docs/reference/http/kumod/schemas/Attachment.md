# Attachment

!!! info
    This page was generated by extracting information from a JSON Schema
    data file for the API.  It may be missing some information, or otherwise
    suggest approximate or placeholder values based on information in the
    schema file; this is due to limitations on how that data is extracted
    from the underlying Rust code and into the JSON Schema, and then again
    from there and into these docs.


This is an object value, with the following properties:


  * `base64` - optional `boolean`. If true, the `data` field must be encoded as base64

  * `content_id` - optional nullable `string`. Optional `Content-ID` header for this attachment.
    If specified, this attachment will be added as an
    inline attachment and a multipart/related MIME
    container will be generated in the message to hold
    it and the textual content.

  * `content_type` - required `string`. The MIME `Content-Type` header that should be
    set for this attachment.

  * `data` - required `string`. The content of the payload.
    This is interpreted as UTF-8 text unless the
    `base64` field is set to `true`.

  * `file_name` - optional nullable `string`. The the preferred filename for the attachment

### Examples

  "base64": false,
