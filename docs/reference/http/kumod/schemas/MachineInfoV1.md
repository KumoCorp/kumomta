# MachineInfoV1

!!! info
    This page was generated by extracting information from a JSON Schema
    data file for the API.  It may be missing some information, or otherwise
    suggest approximate or placeholder values based on information in the
    schema file; this is due to limitations on how that data is extracted
    from the underlying Rust code and into the JSON Schema, and then again
    from there and into these docs.


This is an object value, with the following properties:


  * `container_runtime` - optional nullable `string`. If we detected that we're running in a container, the name
    of the container runtime

  * `cpu_brand` - required `string`. Identifies the CPU.  If you have a mixture of different CPUs,
    this will be a comma separated list of the different CPUs

  * `distribution` - required `string`. The OS distribution

  * `fingerprint` - required `string`. Additional metadata hash(es) that can identify the running machine.
    For example, when running in AWS, the instance-id will be
    included.

  * `hostname` - required `string`. The hostname of the system, as reported by `gethostname(2)`

  * `kernel_version` - optional nullable `string`. The kernel version

  * `mac_address` - required `string`. The MAC address of the primary, non-loopback, network interface

  * `node_id` - required `string`. The NodeID of the system

  * `num_cores` - required `integer`. The number of available CPUs as reported by
    <https://docs.rs/num_cpus/latest/num_cpus/fn.get.html>

  * `online_since` - required `string` (`date-time`). The date/time at which the process was last started

  * `os_version` - required `string`. The OS version (which often includes the distribution)

  * `platform` - required `string`. Identifies the running platform

  * `process_kind` - required `string`. Which process is running. eg: `kumod` vs `tsa-daemon` vs. `proxy-server`.

  * `total_memory_bytes` - required `integer` (`u-int64`). Total physical memory installed in the instance

  * `version` - required `string`. The version of KumoMTA that is running
