# GET /api/admin/trace-smtp-client/v1


!!! note
    This page was generated by extracting information from a JSON Schema
    data file for the API.  It may be missing some information, or otherwise
    suggest approximate or placeholder values based on information in the
    schema file; this is due to limitations on how that data is extracted
    from the underlying Rust code and into the JSON Schema, and then again
    from there and into these docs.

This is a websocket endpoint that provides outbound SMTP tracing.
It cannot be described via auto-generated docs extracted from the JSON Schema.
