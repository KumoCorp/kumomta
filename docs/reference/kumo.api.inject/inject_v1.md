# `kumo.api.inject.inject_v1(request)`

{{since('dev')}}

This is a Lua entrypoint that calls into the [HTTP injection
API](../http/api_inject_v1.md).  The parameter is a request object with
precisely the same semantics as described in the HTTP injection API
documentation.

The request will appear to come from the IPv4 loopback address, even though
no HTTP request is actually involved in this call; it is plumbed through
the same underlying implementation.

Any messages generated by this function will trigger the
[http_message_generated](../events/http_message_generated.md) event as per the
HTTP injection API.

In this example, a copy of the current incoming SMTP message is taken and sent
to an archival service:

```lua
kumo.on('smtp_server_message_received', function(msg)
  kumo.api.inject.inject_v1 {
    envelope_sender = msg:sender().email,
    content = msg:get_data(),
    recipients = { { email = 'archive@example.com' } },
  }
end)
```
