# kumo.http.build_client

```lua
kumo.http.build_client { PARAMS }
```

Constructs an HTTP client object.

The client maintains state, including a connection pool, that can be used
across multiple HTTP requests.

`PARAMS` is an object-style table with the following keys:

* `user_agent` - optional string that will be used to set the `User-Agent` header
  for all requests made by the client
* `connection_verbose` - optional boolean. If true, additional diagnostics
  around the connection attempt will be logged and can be seen by setting the
  diagnostic filter to include `reqwest=trace`. {{since('2024.06.10-84e84b89', inline=True)}}
* `pool_idle_timeout` - optional duration. Sets the maximum time that an idle
  connection remains in the connection pool. The default is `90 seconds`.
  {{since('2024.06.10-84e84b89', inline=True)}}.
* `timeout` - optional duration. Sets the default timeout to use for each
  request made by the client. Can be overridden using the Request object.
  The default is `60 seconds`. {{since('2024.06.10-84e84b89', inline=True)}}.

```lua
local response = kumo.http.build_client({}):get('https://example.com/'):send()
print(response:status_code(), response:status_reason())
for k, v in pairs(response:headers()) do
  print('Header', k, v)
end
print(response:text())
```
