# Unreleased Changes in The Mainline

## Breaking Changes
* We now normalize line breaks in SMTP client responses into spaces, to make it
  a little easier to deal with multi-line responses in both TSA automation,
  response rewriting and bounce classification. Thanks to @cai-n! #157
* We now also strip the enhanced status code prefix from each subsequent line
  of multi-line responses, rather than just the first line. This may influence
  your classification or TSA automation regexes.  For example, for a response
  like `500-5.5.5 foo\n500 5.5.5 bar` we would previously represent that
  with a logged `response.content` value of `foo\n5.5.5 bar`, but will now
  encode it as `foo bar`. See #157 for more context.

## Other Changes and Enhancements

* Added a default timeout of 60 seconds to the HTTP client returned from
  [kumo.http.build_client](../reference/kumo.http/build_client.md).
  Added [request:timeout()](../reference/kumo.http/Request.md#requestimeout)
  method to explicitly set a timeout value.
* You may now list multiple `regex`s and/or multiple `action`s for TSA rules
  by using an array in your toml file. Single values are still supported. #99
* Added [over_sign](../reference/kumo.dkim/rsa_sha256_signer.md#over_sign)
  optional to easily enabled DKIM over-signing to protect your messages
  against replay attacks. The same option can be set for the ed25519_signer
  as well. #111
* Updated RocksDB from 8.1 to 8.10
* Slightly relaxed the MIME parser so that we can tolerate non-conforming 8-bit
  message bodies with missing transfer encoding when all we need is to parse
  headers. The invalid messages will trigger `NEEDS_TRANSFER_ENCODING` when
  using
  [msg:check_fix_conformance()](../reference/message/check_fix_conformance.md)
  to validate messages, but won't cause header parsing to fail in general.
  These non-compliant messages will be parsed (or fixed) using a lossy decode
  to UTF-8 that will remap invalid bytes to `U+FFFD` the Unicode Replacement
  Character.
* Added `max_message_rate` option to
  [kumo:make_queue_config](../reference/kumo/make_queue_config.md)
  to configure the rate at which a given Scheduled Queue can feed
  into the Ready Queue.
* Added
  [request_body_limit](../reference/kumo/start_http_listener.md#request_body_limit)
  option to raise the default HTTP request size, which is useful when
  performing HTTP based injection with large message payloads.
* It is now possible to use `protocol` in the `queues.toml` lua helper
  configuration file. Thanks to @aryeh! #155
* The TSA `Suspend` action will now generate suspensions that are visible
  via the HTTP API and kcli utility, and that will take effect in realtime.
* TSA now supports `SuspendTenant` and `SuspendCampaign` actions that allow
  reacting to source-domain-specific tempfails. These will also be visible
  via the HTTP API and kcli utility, and also take effect in realtime.
* New [glob](../reference/kumo/glob.md),
  [read_dir](../reference/kumo/read_dir.md) and
  [uncached_glob](../reference/kumo/uncached_glob.md) filesystem functions.
  #161
* New [kumo.api.inject.inject_v1](../reference/kumo.api.inject/inject_v1.md) lua
  function for constructing and injecting arbitrary messages via policy. #102
* 4xx and 5xx rejections made by the SMTP server are now logged as `Rejection`
  log records. #88
* New [msg:set_data](../reference/message/set_data.md),
  [msg:append_text_plain](../reference/message/append_text_plain.md),
  [msg:append_text_html](../reference/message/append_text_html.md) message
  methods for amending the message content, which can be used to inject
  tracking pixels. #120
* `kcli bounce` (and the underlying [bounce HTTP
  API](../reference/http/api_admin_bounce_v1.md)) no longer wait for the
  contents of matching scheduled queues to be removed from the spool. This
  reduces contention in the system for large queues, but means that the stats
  returned to the initial request will generally be lower than in previous
  releases. You can use `kcli bounce-list` or the corresponding [bounce HTTP
  API](../reference/http/api_admin_bounce_list_v1.md) to retrieve the totals
  asynchronously.
* [kumo.memoize](../reference/kumo/memoize.md) now includes thundering herd
  protection, which constrains the concurrency of the cache population function
  when there is a cache miss.
* [redis.open](../reference/redis/open.md) now also supports a `connect_timeout`
  option. #168

## Fixes

* The `delivered_this_connection` counter was incorrectly double-counted for
  SMTP sessions, effectively halving the effective value of
  `max_deliveries_per_connection`.
* [msg:set_scheduling](../reference/message/set_scheduling.md) wouldn't take
  effect until after the first transient failure.
* Re-run the ready queue maintainer immediately after closing a connection
  due to reaching the `max_deliveries_per_connection`, so that new connection(s)
  can be established to replace the one that just closed. Previously, we would
  only do this once every minute. #116
* The `smtp_client_rewrite_delivery_status` event could trigger with incorrect
  scheduled queue name components.
* webhooks and other lua delivery handlers didn't reuse connections correctly.
  Thanks to @cai-n! #135
* `OOB` and `ARF` reports were incorrectly logged as `Reception` records
* `OOB` reports did not respect `headers` and `meta` configured in the logger
* MIME Parser would discard whitespace from improperly encoded `message/rfc822`
  parts when rebuilding messages.
* proxy-server didn't actually bind to the requested source address
* `listener_domains.lua` helper didn't always fallback to full wildcard/default
  (`*`) entries correctly. #128
* smtp client did not always wait for the full extent of the idle timeout for
  new messages before closing the connection.
* Potential deadlock on systems with very low core counts when MTA-STS is enabled,
  and sending to domain(s) with an MTA-STS policy.
* If a TSA rule suspends a ready queue in response to a 421-before-MAIL-FROM,
  the contents of the corresponding ready queue could get stuck
