# Unreleased Changes in The Mainline

## Breaking Changes

## Other Changes and Enhancements

* Added a default timeout of 60 seconds to the HTTP client returned from
  [kumo.http.build_client](../reference/kumo.http/build_client.md).
  Added [request:timeout()](../reference/kumo.http/Request.md#requestimeout)
  method to explicitly set a timeout value.
* You may now list multiple `regex`s and/or multiple `action`s for TSA rules
  by using an array in your toml file. Single values are still supported. #99
* Added [over_sign](../reference/kumo.dkim/rsa_sha256_signer.md#over_sign)
  optional to easily enabled DKIM over-signing to protect your messages
  against replay attacks. The same option can be set for the ed25519_signer
  as well. #111
* Updated RocksDB from 8.1 to 8.10
* Slightly relaxed the MIME parser so that we can tolerate non-conforming 8-bit
  message bodies with missing transfer encoding when all we need is to parse
  headers. The invalid messages will trigger `NEEDS_TRANSFER_ENCODING` when
  using
  [msg:check_fix_conformance()](../reference/message/check_fix_conformance.md)
  to validate messages, but won't cause header parsing to fail in general.
  These non-compliant messages will be parsed (or fixed) using a lossy decode
  to UTF-8 that will remap invalid bytes to `U+FFFD` the Unicode Replacement
  Character.
* Added `max_message_rate` option to
  [kumo:make_queue_config](../reference/kumo/make_queue_config.md)
  to configure the rate at which a given Scheduled Queue can feed
  into the Ready Queue.
* Added
  [request_body_limit](../reference/kumo/start_http_listener.md#request_body_limit)
  option to raise the default HTTP request size, which is useful when
  performing HTTP based injection with large message payloads.

## Fixes

* The `delivered_this_connection` counter was incorrectly double-counted for
  SMTP sessions, effectively halving the effective value of
  `max_deliveries_per_connection`.
* Re-run the ready queue maintainer immediately after closing a connection
  due to reaching the `max_deliveries_per_connection`, so that new connection(s)
  can be established to replace the one that just closed. Previously, we would
  only do this once every minute. #116
* The `smtp_client_rewrite_delivery_status` event could trigger with incorrect
  scheduled queue name components.
* webhooks and other lua delivery handlers didn't reuse connections correctly.
  Thanks to @cai-n! #135
* `OOB` and `ARF` reports were incorrectly logged as `Reception` records
* `OOB` reports did not respect `headers` and `meta` configured in the logger
* MIME Parser would discard whitespace from improperly encoded `message/rfc822`
  parts when rebuilding messages.
* proxy-server didn't actually bind to the requested source address
