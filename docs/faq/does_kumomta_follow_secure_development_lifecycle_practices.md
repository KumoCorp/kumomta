# Does KumoMTA Follow Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Practices?

Yes, we follow common SDLC practices:

* Our first party code carefully considers and validates security requirements as part of the design process.
* We leverage github's "Dependabot" and security notification features for automated notifications of potential issues in our dependencies.
* We regularly update those dependencies anyway to stay proactive.
* Third party contributions are carefully reviewed before being accepted and integrated.
