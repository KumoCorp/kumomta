/// Transfer messages from matching queues to an alternative
/// kumomta node.
///
/// The intended purpose of this command is to facilitate manual
/// migration of queues to alternative nodes as part of planned
/// maintenance or part of an orchestrated down-scaling operation.
///
/// Xfering works first by selecting the set of scheduled queues
/// based on matching criteria that you specify via the `--domain`,
/// `--routing-domain`, `--campaign`, `--tenant`, `--queue`,
/// and/or `--everything` options.
///
/// Each matching queue has its messages drained and the xfer
/// logic will amend the message metadata to capture scheduling
/// and due time information and then place the message into
/// a special `.xfer.kumomta.internal` message transfer queue
/// where it will be immediately eligible to be moved to the
/// destination node.
///
/// Upon successful reception on the destination node, the saved
/// scheduling information will be restored to the message
/// and it will be inserted into an appropriate queue on
/// that destination node for delivery at the appropriate time.
///
/// Since the number of messages may be very large, and because
/// processing messages may result in a large amount of I/O
/// to load in every matching message's metadata, the total
/// amount of time taken for an xfer request may be too large
/// to feasibly wait for in the context of a simple request/response.
///
/// With that in mind, the xfer action runs asynchronously: aside from any
/// immediate syntax/request formatting issues, this command
/// will immediately return with no further status indication.
///
/// Errors will be reported in the diagnostic log.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Move messages from the "example.com" queue to the kumomta node
/// running an http listener on `http://10.0.0.1:8000`:
///
/// ```
///    kcli xfer --domain example.com --target http://10.0.0.1:8000
/// ```
