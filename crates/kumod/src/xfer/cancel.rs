/// Allows the system operator to stop a message transfer that was
/// previously initiated via the `/api/admin/xfer/v1` API endpoint.
/// The cancellation works by walking the xfer scheduled queue,
/// reversing the metadata changes made as part of setting up the
/// xfer (to restore the original scheduling information) and then
/// re-inserting the message into an appropriate scheduled queue.
///
/// The cancellation is "instantaneous" in the sense that it applies
/// just once to the specified xfer scheduled queue.  Any other messages
/// that are in-flight or imminently about to be reinserted into
/// that scheduled queue will not be considered, so you may need
/// to trigger the cancellation a few times over short time span
/// to ensure that all messages are taken out of the xfer queue.
///
/// Cancellation requests always complete asynchronously because
/// they may operate on very large quantities of messages, and it
/// is infeasible to wait for completion in the context of
/// a single HTTP request.
